# Playstation-3-Deal-or-No-Deal
CM0511 - Programming for Games 4

In my second year at university there was a module for development on a Playstation 3 development kit. The assignment for this module was to create a game on the development tool with free choice on the game I could create. The game I chose was Deal or no Deal similar to the TV show. The game is completely 2D with dynamic textures so when a player picks up a box with a cash amount in it, the texture on the board turns black to cover up the cash amount that is not out of play.
